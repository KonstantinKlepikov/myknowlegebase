# Пррблемы с fastapi postgresql template

## YAMLLoadWarning

Specify the version of PyYaml < 5.1.

## services.pgadmin.depends_on must be a list

You have to delete all `depends_on` in your `docker-compose.yml.` As far as I know the are not mandatory for running :)

## networks.traefik-public Additional property name is not allowed

Simple fix was to move the version up to `3.6` in the `docker-compose.yml` and that then enabled it to spin up the stack.

## network "traefik-public" is declared as external, but could not be found. You need to create a swarm-scoped network before the stack is deployed

`network create -d overlay traefik-public`

## [[traefik]] version problems

Use `image: traefik:v2.2` in `dockero-compose.yml`
