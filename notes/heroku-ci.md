[основная статья](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci)

Each CI-enabled pipeline is $10/month (prorated to the second) except for Enterprise Teams.

Additionally, dyno and add-on run time for the duration of the test run is charged (prorated to the second).

This pricing enables you to try out Heroku CI with your pipeline for a very low cost.
