- [AllegroGraph](https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/)
  - [AllegroGraph Python client](https://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/6.4.0/python/index.html) offers convenient and efficient access to an AllegroGraph server from a Python-based application. This API provides methods for creating, querying and maintaining RDF data, and for managing the stored triples. The AllegroGraph Python API deliberately emulates the Eclipse RDF4J (formerly Aduna Sesame) API to make it easier to migrate from RDF4J to AllegroGraph.
  - [Gruff](https://allegrograph.com/products/gruff/) is a free Knowledge Graph visualization product from Franz Inc.
