## Bump version

- [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) Version-bump your software with a single command
- [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) is the original project off of which `bump2version` was forked.
- [tbump](https://github.com/tankerhq/tbump) is a complete rewrite, with a nicer UX and additional features, like running commands (aka hooks) before or after the bump. It only works for Git repos right now.
- [ADVbumpversion](https://github.com/andrivet/advbumpversion) is another fork. It offered some features that are now incorporated by its author into `bump2version`.   This fork is thus now deprecated, and it recommends to use `bump2version`
- [zest.releaser](https://pypi.org/project/zest.releaser/) manages your Python package releases and keeps the version number in one location.
- [setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) relies on version control tags and the state of your working copy to determine the version number.
- [incremental](https://pypi.org/project/incremental/) integrates into setuptools and maintains the version number in `_version.py`.
- Invocations [packaging.release](https://invocations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are a set of tasks for [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/). These assume your version is in `_version.py` and you're using semantic versioning.
- [python-semantic.release](https://github.com/relekang/python-semantic-release) automatically bumps your (semantic) version number based on the  types of commits (breaking/new/bugfix) in your source control.
- [PyCalVer](https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/pycalver) is very similar to bump2version, but with support for [calendar based versioning](https://calver.org/).

## Change log building

- [towncrier](https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/) assembles a changelog file from multiple snippets found in individual (merge) commits.
- [releases](https://pypi.org/project/releases/) helps build a Sphinx ReStructuredText changelog.
- [gitchangelog](https://pypi.org/project/gitchangelog/) searches the git commit history to make a configurable changelog file.
