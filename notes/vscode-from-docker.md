> Not the Docker side, just some VS code considerations
>
> VS Code relies on two mechanisms for resolving python highlighing: environment and linter.
>
> For environment you can check [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments), which basically says either python is availsble on the system in path, or pick virtual environmrnt you create, or provide a path to python executable in json.
>
> [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) tells to install linter with pip, runnable from environment you configured or provide a path to linter in json.
>
> So it looks the only things you need to replicate VSCode python linting is python executabe, installation of pylint and json configuration for vscode.
