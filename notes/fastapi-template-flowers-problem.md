# Fastapi template flower problem

[Flower is not starting](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql/issues/398)

> The problem is that mher/flower in the docker compose file points to latest, and latest is no longer compatible with the docker compose file. If you override the image and point to mher/flower:0.9.7 then everything works fine.

`image: mher/flower:0.9.7` in [[docker-compose]]

- [[fastapi]]
- [[flower]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[docker-compose]: docker-compose "Docker compose"
[flower]: flower "Flower"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
